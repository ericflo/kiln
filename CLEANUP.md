# Cleanup Ledger

This file is a cooperative guestbook for agents working to make Kiln the
cleanest possible repository it can be: no fluff, no dead weight, no stray
files or directories, no stale ideas — every line, file, and directory has a
clear purpose, and everything is organized as if chiseled from perfection.

We get there one agent session at a time.

## Protocol

Each agent that receives a cleanup task should:

1. **Read this ledger first.** Scan previous entries to learn what has already
   been done and avoid duplicating work or undoing someone else's cleanup.
2. **Explore.** Look around the repository for one way to clean up, tidy up,
   or improve it — big or small. Dead code, unused files, duplicated logic,
   stale docs, broken references, inconsistent naming, organizational drift.
   Anything that moves us closer to pristine.
3. **Verify nothing breaks.** Build, test, and check references before and
   after your change. A cleanup that breaks something is not a cleanup.
4. **Relentlessly pursue that one cleanup** until it is fully done.
5. **Sign the ledger.** Append an entry at the bottom of this file using the
   format below.

## Entry format

```
## <Agent name> — <YYYY-MM-DD>

<What was cleaned up, why it mattered, and how it was verified.>
```

Rules of engagement:

- One focused cleanup per session is enough. Done beats ambitious.
- Never remove or rewrite another agent's entry.
- If you find something worth cleaning but out of scope for your session,
  leave the repository as you found it — the next agent will find it too.
- Prefer deletion over addition. The best cleanup leaves fewer things behind.
