RLM-FORGE is not a new model architecture. It is a runtime-hosted realization of a Recursive Language Model style execution loop:

- **Hermes Agent** acts as the inner LM runtime.
- **Ouroboros** owns recursion, scheduling, state mutation, termination, and trace replay.
- **TraceGuard** validates that parent synthesis only claims facts backed by accepted child evidence handles.

The result is a compact, replayable, evidence-gated RLM scaffold built on top of the existing Hermes tool/runtime interface.

---

## What this proves

RLM-FORGE makes one careful claim:

> Recursive execution is useful when it creates structured evidence handles that an outer scaffold can validate. Recursion alone is not trusted.

The current committed result supports the following bounded public claim:

> RLM-FORGE completed a 24-cell live primary matrix across Hermes GLM, Claude Code Opus, and Codex GPT-5.5 in read-write memory mode. All cells passed the RLM-FORGE+TraceGuard contract, with fresh child evidence validation passing in every cell and zero unsupported parent claims accepted. Memory was used only as an operational prior for schema stability, not as admissible factual evidence.

A set of deterministic memory-runtime benchmarks isolates the performance claim
we can safely make today: guarded operational memory can reject answer-memory
contamination, separate layered memory roles, and reduce validation/repair work
for known schema failure modes. It does **not** prove live model-quality,
latency, token, or cost improvement.

| Benchmark | Strongest deterministic result |
| --- | --- |
| Memory contamination robustness | Unguarded adversarial memory accepts answer contamination at 1.0000; TraceGuard accepts it at 0.0000 |
| Layered memory ablation | Hermes memory + RLM-FORGE memory reaches 1.0000 initial accept with 0.0000 repairs |
| Adaptive repair memory | Mean repair calls fall from 1.0000 to 0.1250 across repeated related tasks |
| Guarded memory runtime benefit | Initial TraceGuard accept rises from 0.2500 to 1.0000 versus no memory |

Artifact: [`experiments/memory-runtime-benefit-benchmark.md`](experiments/memory-runtime-benefit-benchmark.md)

We also ran the paper itself through the dependency `ooo rlm` path. The run
decomposed the paper target into bounded chunks, executed child Hermes calls,
and synthesized a parent answer from the child results. RLM-FORGE now provides
project-local `ouroboros`/`ooo` console-script wrappers for `uv run ouroboros
rlm` or `uv run ooo rlm` that install TraceGuard immediately after parent
synthesis, then delegate to the upstream Ouroboros Typer app. The earlier
persisted post-run gate over that exact parent output accepted the
evidence-backed parent and rejected an injected memory-answer claim:

| Case | TraceGuard accepted | Unsupported rate | Rejection |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| exact `ooo rlm` parent | true | 0.0000 | none |
| parent + unsafe memory answer | false | 0.0667 | `unsupported_fact_id` |

Artifacts:
[`experiments/paper-key-sections-ooo-rlm-demo.md`](experiments/paper-key-sections-ooo-rlm-demo.md),
[`experiments/paper-ooo-rlm-traceguard-gate.md`](experiments/paper-ooo-rlm-traceguard-gate.md)

On the current live Hermes long-context truncation fixture, recursive RLM and vanilla single-call Hermes are an honest **tie**:

| Metric | Vanilla single call | Recursive RLM |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Hermes sub-calls | 1 | 5 |
| Quality score | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Score delta | — | +0.00 |
| `omitted_fact_safety_score` | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| `claimed_omitted_fact_ids` | `[]` | `[]` |
| `cited_retained_fact_ids` | `LC-001..LC-004` | `LC-001..LC-004` |

Earlier artifacts reported a `+0.20` RLM advantage because the scorer treated guarded residual-gap text such as “LC-005 and LC-006 cannot be claimed” as a positive omitted-fact claim. The claim-aware scorer fixes that. The contribution here is **not** a quality win on one fixture; it is the Hermes-backed recursive runtime path plus deterministic evidence enforcement.

Persisted artifact: [`benchmarks/rlm-long-context-truncation-v1.json`](benchmarks/rlm-long-context-truncation-v1.json)

Live primary portability:
[`experiments/live-portability-primary.md`](experiments/live-portability-primary.md)
runs 8 shared fixtures through three runtime/provider families using the same
RLM-FORGE+TraceGuard contract. This is a 24-cell primary matrix, not the full
96-cell baseline sweep. Latest aggregate status is **pass**: Hermes+GLM,
Claude Code, and Codex each complete and pass all 8 primary fixtures. The
runtime has also seen a concrete missing-handle failure class in an earlier
Hermes+GLM run; that class is now covered by a deterministic TraceGuard
repair/retry loop. If it recurs, the runtime has a recovery path instead of
only a reject-and-log path. The latest live run passes before repair is needed,
so the repair loop is evidence of the runtime control surface rather than a
claimed benchmark win in the latest matrix.

| Family | Model alias | Primary cells | Live result | Mean latency |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| `hermes_glm` | `glm-4.7` via Z.AI | 8/8 pass | `pass` | 156s |
| `claude_code_opus47` | `opus` via Claude Code | 8/8 pass | `pass` | 69s |
| `codex_gpt55` | `gpt-5.5` via Codex CLI | 8/8 pass | `pass` | 53s |

Live portability smoke:
[`experiments/live-portability-smoke.md`](experiments/live-portability-smoke.md)
remains the 1-fixture adapter/auth check that preceded the primary run.

TraceGuard enforcement demo:
[`experiments/traceguard-demo.md`](experiments/traceguard-demo.md)
shows the new evidence gate in action. Safe parent synthesis is accepted,
an omitted fact is rejected with `unsupported_fact_id`, and chunk-only
evidence is rejected with `chunk_handle_without_fact`. This turns the main
claim from “we measured unsupported claims” into “we can enforce the evidence
contract at parent synthesis time.”

---

## Why Hermes

Hermes is unusually well-suited to this kind of runtime experiment:

| Hermes property | Why it matters for RLM-FORGE |
| --- | --- |
| Provider-agnostic runtime | The inner LM can be swapped with `hermes model` without changing the recursion scaffold. |
| Tool/RPC-shaped execution | Hermes' structured “one bounded task in, one result out” style maps naturally to RLM sub-call envelopes. |
| Quiet structured I/O | Ouroboros can call Hermes like a function and validate the resulting JSON. |
| Isolated subagent potential | Future RLM trees can expand horizontally through Hermes subagents instead of a single serial path. |

RLM-FORGE treats Hermes as the only recursive inference boundary. Hermes proposes local decomposition, atomic execution, summary, or synthesis for one bounded node. Ouroboros alone decides recursion, mutation, retry, and termination.

---

## TraceGuard

TraceGuard is the small deterministic layer that turns a trace into an enforceable contract.

```python
from rlm_forge import build_manifest_from_fixture, validate_parent_synthesis

result = validate_parent_synthesis(
    evidence_manifest=build_manifest_from_fixture(fixture),
    parent_synthesis=parent_json,
)
```

Representative no-API output:

```text
safe_parent_synthesis: ACCEPT (unsupported_claim_rate=0.0000)
unsafe_omitted_fact: REJECT (unsupported_claim_rate=0.2000)
chunk_only_no_fact: REJECT (unsupported_claim_rate=1.0000)
```

TraceGuard rejects two important failure modes:

| Failure mode | Rejection reason |
| --- | --- |
| Parent claims an omitted fact not present in accepted child evidence | `unsupported_fact_id` |
| Parent cites a chunk handle but no supported fact | `chunk_handle_without_fact` |

Demo artifact: [`experiments/traceguard-demo.md`](experiments/traceguard-demo.md)

---

## Quickstart

RLM-FORGE requires **Python 3.12+**.

### 1. Install Hermes

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc       # or ~/.zshrc
hermes setup           # configure provider + API key
hermes --version       # confirm v0.11+
```

The simplest provider for judges is OpenRouter: set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and select any model.

### 2. Install RLM-FORGE

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Q00/rlm-forge.git
cd rlm-forge
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

The package pins a git-ref dependency on the Ouroboros commit that contains the RLM modules and claim-aware scorer until those APIs are released on PyPI.

### 3. Verify without a Hermes API key

```bash
pytest -q
python3 -m rlm_forge.replay benchmarks/rlm-long-context-truncation-v1.json
python3 scripts/run-traceguard-demo.py
```

Expected replay signal:

```text
quality: vanilla=1.00, rlm=1.00, delta=+0.00, rlm_outperforms_vanilla=False
```

### 4. Run the live truncation benchmark

```bash
ooo rlm --truncation-benchmark
```

This command performs one vanilla Hermes call plus five recursive Hermes sub-calls. Use the replay command above for no-API evaluation.

Expected live shape:

```text
Shared truncation benchmark completed; vanilla Hermes and recursive RLM outputs were recorded.
hermes_subcalls: vanilla=1, rlm=5
chunks: selected=4, omitted=2
quality: vanilla=1.00, rlm=1.00, delta=+0.00, rlm_outperforms_vanilla=False
```

---

## Two integration paths

| Path | Entry point | Where Hermes is called |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recursive scaffold | `ooo rlm --truncation-benchmark` | `ouroboros.rlm.loop.RLMOuterScaffoldLoop` drives 1 root + 4 chunk sub-calls through `HermesCliRuntime`. |
| AC decomposition pipeline | `decompose_ac(hermes_runtime=...)` | `ouroboros.execution.decomposition.decompose_ac` accepts an `AgentRuntime` and delegates child-AC generation to Hermes. |

The default `ooo run` and `ooo evolve` flows keep their original LLM-only behaviour. Passing `hermes_runtime=None` bypasses every RLM-specific branch.

Offline replay, scorer, TraceGuard, and deterministic ablation artifacts do
not require a Hermes API key. The live portability artifacts are persisted for
inspection; rerunning them requires provider credentials. TraceGuard improves
unsupported-claim enforcement; it does not change the live fixture quality
score, which remains a tie.

Additional scorer experiment:
[`experiments/claim-aware-omitted-fact-suite.md`](experiments/claim-aware-omitted-fact-suite.md)
runs seven controlled completion shapes without Hermes. It verifies that the
corrected scorer accepts guarded gap mentions but rejects positive omitted-fact
claims and omitted evidence references.

Broader scorer stress test:
[`experiments/synthetic-omitted-fact-benchmark.md`](experiments/synthetic-omitted-fact-benchmark.md)
generates 108 truncation fixtures and scores seven deterministic completion
strategies, for 756 total scorer checks. It is not a live-model benchmark; it
supports the narrower claim that the evaluation harness separates guarded gap
mentions, unsupported omitted-fact claims, chunk-only citations, and missing
boundary reports across many fixture shapes.

Contract ablation:
[`experiments/unsupported-claim-rate-benchmark.md`](experiments/unsupported-claim-rate-benchmark.md)
compares six execution contracts over 72 generated fixtures. The
evidence-gated Hermes-RLM contract has a 0.0000 unsupported-claim rate, while
the same recursive shape without evidence gating has a 1.0000 unsupported-claim
rate. This supports the precise systems claim: recursion is useful because it
creates evidence handles that Ouroboros can validate, not because recursion
alone makes hallucination impossible.

Memory runtime benefit:
[`experiments/memory-runtime-benefit-benchmark.md`](experiments/memory-runtime-benefit-benchmark.md)
compares three memory policies over 20 fixtures and four provider-failure
profiles. The guarded operational memory prior improves initial TraceGuard
acceptance from 0.2500 to 1.0000 versus the no-memory policy and reduces mean
repair calls from 0.2500 to 0.0000. This is a controlled runtime-performance
result: memory helps the scaffold avoid known schema/handle repair work, while
TraceGuard still rejects answer-memory contamination.

Memory contribution benchmarks:
[`experiments/memory-contamination-robustness-benchmark.md`](experiments/memory-contamination-robustness-benchmark.md),
[`experiments/layered-memory-ablation-benchmark.md`](experiments/layered-memory-ablation-benchmark.md),
and [`experiments/adaptive-repair-memory-benchmark.md`](experiments/adaptive-repair-memory-benchmark.md)
separate three stronger claims. TraceGuard turns adversarial answer memory from
accepted state into a rejected unsupported claim. Hermes-style prompt memory
and RLM-FORGE guarded memory fix different deterministic failure classes in a
2x2 ablation. Adaptive operational memory learns from the first missing-handle
repair and reduces mean repair calls from 1.0000 to 0.1250 on later related
tasks.

Paper `ooo rlm` demo:
[`experiments/paper-key-sections-ooo-rlm-demo.md`](experiments/paper-key-sections-ooo-rlm-demo.md)
records an actual dependency `ouroboros rlm` run, the terminal counterpart to
`ooo rlm`, over a mechanically extracted paper contribution target. The run
uses four child Hermes calls plus one parent synthesis call. The parent
consumes all child results and recovers the contribution boundary: runtime
lifting, Ouroboros/Hermes/TraceGuard role separation, memory as policy, and no
live quality/cost/token/latency overclaim.

Post-run TraceGuard gate:
[`experiments/paper-ooo-rlm-traceguard-gate.md`](experiments/paper-ooo-rlm-traceguard-gate.md)
normalizes that exact `ooo rlm` parent output into TraceGuard
fact/evidence-handle form. The evidence-backed parent is accepted with
unsupported rate 0.0000. The same parent contaminated with an unsupported
`MEMORY-ANSWER` fact is rejected with `unsupported_fact_id`. This is a post-run
gate over the persisted `ooo rlm` output.

In-process `ooo rlm` gate:
[`src/rlm_forge/ooo_rlm_traceguard.py`](src/rlm_forge/ooo_rlm_traceguard.py)
adapts the dependency Ouroboros parent schema into TraceGuard's existing
fact/evidence-handle validator. It turns fresh `child_result_id` plus child
chunk handles into the accepted evidence manifest, normalizes parent
`supported_by_child_result_ids` into claim references, and rejects parent facts
that do not cite the current run's child evidence. [`src/rlm_forge/ouroboros_cli.py`](src/rlm_forge/ouroboros_cli.py)
installs this process-local gate for the project-local `uv run ouroboros` and
`uv run ooo` entrypoints, so the dependency package in `.venv` is not mutated.
[`experiments/ooo-rlm-inprocess-traceguard-gate.md`](experiments/ooo-rlm-inprocess-traceguard-gate.md)
shows the gate catching a real raw-parent handle defect in the persisted paper
run: the parent cited `rlm_node_root:child_result:004`, but the run produced
only child results `000..003`. After repairing that handle to fresh child
evidence, the parent accepts with unsupported rate 0.0000; adding a
`MEMORY-ANSWER` fact is rejected.
[`experiments/ooo-rlm-live-inprocess-traceguard-run.md`](experiments/ooo-rlm-live-inprocess-traceguard-run.md)
records the live wrapper path after the integration: `uv run --extra dev ooo
rlm ...` completes four child Hermes calls plus one parent synthesis call and
prints `TraceGuard accepted parent synthesis (unsupported_rate=0.0000,
claims=4)` before reporting command success.

---

## What the live experiment proves

The 24-cell live run is a systems experiment, not a leaderboard. Its purpose
is to test whether an RLM-style child/parent contract can run across real
agent runtimes while a deterministic validator controls what may become parent
state.

The useful result is not "all models got the answer right." The useful result
is that RLM-FORGE exposes a runtime surface:

1. child calls return structured facts with evidence handles;
2. parent synthesis must cite those handles;
3. TraceGuard rejects parent claims that lack accepted evidence;
4. the same contract can be exercised through Hermes, Claude Code, and Codex.

The chunk-only citation trap is the useful stress case. In an earlier
Hermes+GLM run, GLM preserved the fact text but emitted one
`evidence_chunk_id` as `null`; TraceGuard rejected that parent claim before it
could become accepted state. The latest full rerun passes this cell because
GLM includes the required handle. The important point is that the runtime now
has a narrow response if that observed class recurs: when rejection is
exclusively `missing_evidence_handle`, the repair loop fills only missing/null
handle fields from the child evidence manifest and retries parent synthesis
once. This turns the observed failure from a terminal contract failure into a
bounded, inspectable recovery step.

TraceGuard is not an LLM judge. It does not ask another model whether the
answer "seems correct." It checks the manifest deterministically:

```text
fresh child evidence + fact_id + evidence_chunk_id -> accepted parent claim
missing handle / omitted fact / chunk-only citation -> rejected parent claim
```

## Experimental memory-shaped recursion

RLM-FORGE now includes an experimental memory mode for the live portability
harness. It turns decomposition traces, provider-specific failures, schema
repairs, and TraceGuard rejections into persistent operational priors for later
recursive runs.

The important rule is:

```text
Memory is not evidence; memory is a prior over how to ask for evidence.
```

In that framing, memory never stores "this fixture's answer is X." The memory
backend is schema-first and guarded. It can store operational lessons such as:

- long-context preservation tasks work better when child outputs preserve
  `fact_id` and `evidence_chunk_id` together;
- a provider may be slow but schema-stable, or fast but prone to handle
  omissions;
- TraceGuard rejection patterns can drive retry prompts or stricter child
  schemas;
- routing can specialize over time: decomposition, evidence extraction,
  synthesis, and repair may prefer different providers.

The live path now builds TraceGuard's accepted evidence manifest from the
current run's child outputs, not from memory. Memory can only enter prompts as
structured `memory_priors` for schema or retry policy. Every new parent claim
still has to cite fresh child evidence and pass TraceGuard.

There is also an observed layered-memory effect when Hermes is the inner
runtime. `HermesCliRuntime` calls `hermes chat -Q --source tool -q <prompt>`
without `--ignore-rules`, so Hermes' own built-in `MEMORY.md` can be injected
before the explicit RLM-FORGE prompt. In this environment, Hermes sessions
created after an RLM-FORGE run contained RLM-FORGE operational prior entries in
their system prompts. That layer is useful as a behavior prior, but it is not
part of the TraceGuard evidence manifest. Details and session evidence are in
[`docs/hermes-layered-memory-flow.md`](docs/hermes-layered-memory-flow.md).

The stronger contribution is evidence-admissible memory for agent runtimes:
memory may shape decomposition, schema discipline, and repair policy, but only
fresh child evidence can support parent claims. The deterministic contribution
benchmarks can be regenerated with:

```bash
python scripts/run-memory-contribution-benchmarks.py
```

```bash
python scripts/run-live-portability-matrix.py \
  --mode live-primary \
  --memory-mode read-write \
  --memory-store .rlm-forge-memory.jsonl \
  --output-prefix live-portability-primary-memory
```

The default remains `--memory-mode off` for clean baseline runs. Memory runs
should be reported separately from no-memory baselines and should claim only a
runtime feedback loop, not a model-quality improvement.

Memory live experiment:
[`experiments/live-portability-primary-memory-fixed.md`](experiments/live-portability-primary-memory-fixed.md)
records the May 4, 2026 `read-write` memory run across the same 24-cell
primary matrix. The run passed all required cells with memory enabled:
Hermes+GLM, Claude Code, and Codex each completed and passed all 8 primary
fixtures. TraceGuard accepted every final parent synthesis, the fresh child
evidence gate had zero failures, and the memory backend stored 24 operational
observations with zero rejected memory candidates.

| Memory mode | Family | Primary cells | Fresh evidence failures | TraceGuard failures |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `read-write` | `hermes_glm` | 8/8 pass | 0 | 0 |
| `read-write` | `claude_code_opus47` | 8/8 pass | 0 | 0 |
| `read-write` | `codex_gpt55` | 8/8 pass | 0 | 0 |

The durable memory log for that run is
[`experiments/live-portability-memory-primary-fixed.jsonl`](experiments/live-portability-memory-primary-fixed.jsonl).
It contains operational priors such as `preserve_child_fact_identity`, not
fixture answers or retained factual chunks.

## What RLM-FORGE is and is not

| It is | It is not |
| --- | --- |
| A Hermes-backed RLM runtime MVP | A new model architecture |
| A replayable trace and evidence-validation scaffold | A claim that recursion alone prevents hallucination |
| A practical integration recipe for Hermes + Ouroboros | A production RLM service |
| A deterministic TraceGuard enforcement demo | A benchmark suite proving model-quality superiority |

This is an MVP designed to demonstrate that Hermes can serve as the inner
recursive LM in an RLM-style scaffold with replayable traces and deterministic
evaluation. It is not a production-ready RLM service, does not claim novelty
over the Zhang et al. paper, and no longer claims a quality advantage from the
single truncation fixture. The experimental memory mode should improve
decomposition, routing, and repair policy only; it does not replace fresh trace
evidence for parent claims.

python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest -q
```

## Examples

| Script | What it does | Hermes calls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `examples/01-dry-run.sh` | Validate the RLM path, no side effects | 0 |
| `examples/02-vanilla-baseline.sh` | One vanilla Hermes call on the truncation fixture | 1 |
| `examples/03-truncation-comparison.sh` | Side-by-side vanilla vs recursive RLM | 1 + 5 |

Each script is a one-liner that wraps the Ouroboros CLI.

## Architecture

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the layer model,
orchestration boundaries, and 6-step sub-call lifecycle. The full concept
design is `docs/guides/recursive-language-model.md` in the upstream
Ouroboros repository (1,580 lines).
