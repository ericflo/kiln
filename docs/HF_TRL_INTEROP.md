# HF/TRL Interoperability Contract

Kiln's native trainer is the bounded `native_online_lora_v1` single-GPU LoRA
profile described in [NATIVE_SFT_PROFILE.md](NATIVE_SFT_PROFILE.md). General,
distributed, and broadly configurable training belongs in Hugging Face
Transformers, TRL, and PEFT. The interoperability route moves data and
adapters between those systems without discarding the identities needed to
audit the handoff.

The version-1 manifest, validation library, and atomic SFT bundle writer are
implemented. The public export/import API and reference training scripts are
not yet available; until those surfaces ship, Kiln does not claim that
manually assembled PEFT output has passed this contract.

## Bundle Model

One handoff directory contains two independently self-verifying documents:

- `kiln_hf_export.json` (`kiln.hf-trl-export.v1`) is written by Kiln before
  external training.
- `kiln_hf_result.json` (`kiln.hf-trl-result.v1`) is written after external
  training and refers to the exact export digest.

The export binds all of the following:

- the served model ID and complete base-weight shard manifest;
- the validated execution provenance of the Kiln process that made the
  export, cross-checked against the exported model/tokenizer/template files;
- exact model configuration, tokenizer, and tokenizer-vocabulary identity;
- inference, native-training, and TRL-training template bytes;
- exact exported dataset bytes, ordered corpus identity, and row count;
- the complete SFT ingestion receipt, including ordered kept and rejected row
  hashes, or the exact rollout-provenance schema for GRPO;
- an optional evaluation split manifest and optional input PEFT adapter; and
- Kiln's exact reference script and pinned Python environment lock.

The result binds the export digest, task, package versions, trainer kind,
effective configuration, preserved executed-script bytes, and exact PEFT
configuration and safetensors output. A custom script is permitted and remains
distinguishable from Kiln's reference script by content hash.

Every artifact identity contains a normalized relative path, nonzero byte
length, and a complete lowercase `sha256:<64 hex>` digest. Bundle paths must
not be absolute, contain `..`, contain backslashes, or traverse symlinks.
Readers reject unsupported schema versions, unknown or duplicate fields,
missing files, non-regular files, and byte or length mismatches.

SFT exports declare `assistant_only_generation_spans`: labels must come from
the TRL template's generation blocks. The compact selection fields in the
export manifest are cross-checked against the complete `sft_ingestion.json`
receipt, including its source, row counts, invalid-row policy, ordered corpus
digest, and internally validated per-row identities.

## Template Identities

The three template artifacts are intentionally distinct:

- `chat_template.jinja` is the inference template loaded by Kiln.
- `kiln_training_chat_template.jinja` is the exact effective template identity
  retained in native checkpoints, receipts, and adapters.
- `training_chat_template.jinja` is the template supplied to HF/TRL.

For the source-pinned Qwen3.5 route, the last file retains TRL's
`{% generation %}` blocks for assistant-only labels. Kiln's native minijinja
renderer cannot parse that extension, so its effective identity uses the same
template with those blocks converted through Kiln's internal span path. The
two hashes must not be substituted for one another.

## Stable Digests

Manifest self-digests exclude only their own digest field. Kiln recursively
sorts JSON object keys, emits compact UTF-8 JSON, hashes the resulting bytes
with SHA-256, and prefixes the lowercase digest with `sha256:`. Arrays retain
their order.

Effective trainer settings use tagged values: `boolean`, `integer`,
`unsigned`, `decimal`, `text`, and `text_list`. Decimal values are finite
numbers carried as exact strings. This avoids cross-language digest drift from
valid but different Rust and Python floating-point JSON spellings.

The result's executed script is preserved as `executed_train.py`. Import can
therefore report whether it is byte-identical to the exported `train.py`
without preventing deliberate custom training code.

## Atomic SFT Bundles

Library-created export directories end in `.kiln-hf` and are immutable. The
writer revalidates every prepared example against the server-owned ingestion
receipt and tokenizer before writing. It then snapshots only the declared
model, tokenizer, template, dataset, receipt, script, environment, split, and
optional adapter artifacts into a new sibling staging directory.

Every file is created without overwrite and synced before its identity enters
the manifest. The complete file set, manifest self-digest, cross-record
identities, and artifact hashes are validated in staging. Publication is one
directory rename followed by a parent-directory sync; in-process failure
removes staging, and an existing final target is never replaced. Optional
input-adapter files reject symlinks and are copied while the caller holds its
adapter revision stable.

## Validation Boundary

This contract proves byte and identity continuity across an explicitly
provided handoff. It does not prove that an external process executed the
reported script, that package version strings are trustworthy, or that the
trainer produced a correct optimization result. The pinned reference scripts,
oracle fixtures, and round-trip tests provide behavioral evidence separately.

Import must validate both self-digests, the result-to-export link, every
referenced file, trainer/task consistency, and current resident
base/tokenizer/template identities before publishing an adapter. Validation is
performed on a Kiln-owned, quiescent bundle directory; concurrently mutating a
bundle during validation is outside the contract.
