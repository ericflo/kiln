# Candle Removal Plan (#1082)

This document inventories every `candle_core` and `candle_nn` reference in
the kiln workspace and the migration path to a candle-free build. It is
the canonical artifact for tracking Phase 7 closeout against issue #1082.

Last refreshed: 2026-05-25, against `main` post-merge of `ce/1082-pagedkv-accessors-migrate` (`40666082`) + 9 Metal/Vulkan kernel wires (`ddee82e6`, `1471dafb`, `b5ec4874`, `a88d0842`, `93ad0360`, `bb2e6283`, `5d9dcef3`, `742cf7e4`, `c846f188`) + 10 cuda_train.rs kt-API wires (`ddd8379c` through `e99a1a42`).

## Removal sequencing

Removal proceeds bottom-up: leaf crates first (they have the smallest blast
radius), then the high-traffic kernel crates, then `kiln-model`, then the
bridges, finally the vendor delete.

### Tier 0 — already candle-free (kt-substrate primary)

- `kiln-core`        — never depended on candle directly.
- `kiln-scheduler`   — never depended on candle directly.
- `kiln-nvtx`        — never depended on candle directly.

### Tier 1 — leaf crates with minimal candle surface

| Crate | candle deps | Migration path |
|---|---|---|
| `kiln-blas`             | `dep:candle-core` (optional, `cublaslt`/`probe` features) | Drop once the cublasLt probe binary is moved to a standalone debug crate or rewritten against `cudarc` directly. |
| `kiln-conv1d-kernel`    | `candle-core` (cuda feature) | Drop the candle-typed surface once all callers use `kt_api::*_kt`. |
| `kiln-marlin-gemm`      | `candle-core` (cuda feature) | Same as conv1d. |
| `kiln-flash-attn`       | `candle-core` (cuda feature) | Same; 5/5 kt_api smoke tests already green. |
| `kiln-rmsnorm-kernel`   | `candle-core` (cuda feature) | Same; 25/25 kt_api smoke tests already green. |
| `kiln-gdn-kernel`       | `candle-core` (cuda feature) + `candle-nn` | Same; 20/20 kt_api smoke tests already green. |

For each Tier-1 crate, removing candle means:

1. Migrate every production caller in `kiln-model::forward` and
   `kiln-train` from the candle-typed entry to the `kt_api::*_kt` entry
   (zero-copy borrow path).
2. Delete the candle-typed `lib.rs` surface.
3. Delete the `candle-core` line from the crate `Cargo.toml`.
4. Verify `cargo check --release -p kiln-<crate> --features cuda`.

### Tier 2 — opd-loss + flce + mps + vulkan

| Crate | Notes |
|---|---|
| `kiln-opd-loss-kernel`  | Smaller surface; mirror the rmsnorm path. |
| `kiln-flce-kernel`      | **Largest single rewrite.** Phase A is pure-candle, Phase B is the raw-CUDA replacement. Driving Phase B to closeout is its own multi-PR effort (see crate-level `phase_b.rs`). |
| `kiln-mps`              | Apple Silicon only; Metal storage substrate lives here. |
| `kiln-vulkan-kernel`    | 20 .rs files importing candle. Most are integration shims that can be removed once `kiln-tensor`s Vulkan backend is fully wired (current scaffolds: ~30 `vulkan_fwd: Ok(None)` sites). |

### Tier 3 — `kiln-model` (the forward pass)

27 .rs files. The candle surface here is the most diffuse and the most
performance-sensitive. Migration proceeds op-family by op-family, with
each migration env-gated by a `KILN_USE_KT_API_*` flag so the gate can be
flipped to default-on after a clean parity-test cycle.

State today (post-#f569b7be):

- 40+ env-gated kt-API parallel paths landed; each defaults off.
- The `KILN_USE_KT_API_ALL=1` master switch flips all gates on at once.
- `PagedKvCache` ↔ `PagedKvCacheKt` migration is partial — constructor +
  writer wired, first end-to-end production site flipped via bench
  (`d5bba062`), ~10 decode call sites remain on the candle path.

Remaining work to drop the candle dep from `kiln-model`:

1. Finish the PagedKvCacheKt call-site migration.
2. Promote every `try_kt_*` helper from opt-in to default-on by removing
   its env gate (after a parity cycle).
3. Delete the candle fallback branches in the `if let Some(out) =
   try_kt_*` patterns.

### Tier 4 — `kiln-kt-bridge` (the bridge itself)

By design, `kiln-kt-bridge` IS the candle↔kt boundary. Its `candle-core`
dep is removed last: once every production path is on kt-typed tensors,
the bridge collapses to a thin device-id translation layer (or is
deleted entirely).

### Tier 5 — vendor delete

After every `crates/*/Cargo.toml` has no candle entry:

```bash
# Verify no transitive candle dep anywhere
cargo tree --workspace -i candle-core   # should be empty

# Delete the vendor tree
rm -rf vendor/candle-core/

# Remove the workspace patch
sed -i "/candle-core.*path.*vendor/d" Cargo.toml
```

## Build matrix coverage required before each tier closes

| Tier | Required CI green |
|---|---|
| Tier 1 crate close | `linux-default` + `linux-cuda` (the kernel crates own gate) |
| Tier 2 crate close | Same + `macos-metal` for `kiln-mps`, `linux-vulkan` for `kiln-vulkan-kernel` |
| Tier 3 close       | Full matrix + opd/sft regression nightlies green |
| Tier 4 close       | Full matrix |
| Tier 5 delete      | Full matrix + a fresh `cargo tree -i candle-core` returning empty |

## Status snapshot (2026-05-25, refreshed)

- Tier 0: ✅ already candle-free (kiln-core, kiln-scheduler, kiln-nvtx).
- Tier 1: 🟡 in flight — all 5 kernel crates have kt_api surfaces.
  **Production wiring breakthrough** (#695587df): first kt_api production wire
  for a non-rmsnorm kernel crate. kiln-conv1d-kernel's `causal_conv1d_update_kt`
  + `causal_conv1d_prefill_kt` are now both wired in `CudaBackend` at
  `crates/kiln-model/src/backend/cuda.rs:1004` and `:1038`.
  Status by crate:
    - kiln-rmsnorm-kernel: 7 production `_kt` callers in forward.rs ✓
    - kiln-conv1d-kernel: 2/2 kt_api functions wired in CudaBackend ✓ + byte-exact parity tests at B=1/C=8192 (`69a5f68c` update + `1cb0c107` prefill, 0 mismatches across 8192/65536 output elements and 24576 conv_state elements)
    - kiln-marlin-gemm: 1/1 kt_api function wired in marlin_proj::matmul_bf16 ✓ (`8b415107` + `668b0847` bridge extension for I32→U32)
    - kiln-gdn-kernel: 5/10 kt_api functions wired in CudaBackend ✓ (`forward_substitution`/`14c17570`, `recurrent_forward`/`7a357a3d`, `chunk_prep`/`68a3667e`, `chunk_scan`/`1edc82dc`, `full_chunk_forward_multiblock`/`57b37c00`) — 5 remaining (decode_gates_recurrent variants + gated_rms_norm)
    - kiln-flash-attn: 1/5 production wires ✓ (`flash_attn_fwd_kt` in CudaBackend::flash_attn_prefill at `f3b7e797` behind `KILN_USE_KT_API_FLASH_ATTN`) + 2/5 functions used internally by `paged_kv_cache_kt.rs` (`paged_kv_write_token_major_bf16_slot_kt` + `_bf16_kt`); 4 entry points remaining (paged_decode + paged_decode_dyn_seqlen + bwd + 1 more kv_write helper)
    - kiln-opd-loss-kernel: separate phase (full rewrite for Phase B)
- Tier 2: 🟡 in flight — flce-kernel Phase B is the standout rewrite effort.
  Metal + Vulkan backends now have real kernel wires landed for 9 ops
  (rmsnorm, layernorm, l2norm, silu, sigmoid, softmax, elementwise binary
  add/sub/mul/div, cast f32↔bf16, index_select_dim0).
- Tier 3: 🟡 in flight — kiln-model has 40+ env-gated kt-API parallel paths
  in forward.rs + cuda_train.rs. PagedKvCacheKt accessor migration now
  has 5 parity helpers (`try_kt_paged_kv_{block_size, is_fp8,
  pool_tensors_present, num_layers, num_blocks}`) + 9 production accessor
  read sites migrated. All defaults remain off.
- Tier 4: ⏳ blocked on Tier 1 + Tier 3.
- Tier 5: ⏳ blocked on everything above.

This document is updated as tiers close — search-replace the 🟡/⏳ marks
as each tier reaches the relevant `Required CI green` gate.
